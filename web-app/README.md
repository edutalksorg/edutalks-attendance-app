# HR Web App (Next.js)

This is a minimal Next.js scaffold for the HR Attendance + Payroll system.

Environment:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` to your backend API (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/api`).

Scripts:
- `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start development server.

Notes:
- This scaffold provides a minimal `AuthContext` and API client. Expand pages to match mobile flows (attendance, calendar, teams, payroll, profile).
